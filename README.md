# UdacityAndroidDeveloperJavaPopularMovieApp
This was a programming assignment for the Udacity Android Developer program. It's actually a very useful app that I use oftren.
It does downloads movie information from the th3eooviedb, note that the api key is not in this repo.
To run the app you'll need to get a free api key from the moviedb.
The app has a MVVM architecture and stores movie information in a Room database.
